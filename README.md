  #include <stdio.h>	  																							
		Example printf, scanf etc. If we want to use printf or scanf function in our program, we should include the stdio.																							
																									
	#include <stdlib.h>	h is the header of the general purpose standard library of C programming language which includes functions involving memory allocation, 																							
		process control, conversions and others.																							
																									
	#include <string.h>	string. h is a standard header file in the C language that contains functions for manipulating strings (arrays of characters). 																							
		<string. h> header file contains some useful string functions that can be directly used in a program by invoking the #include preprocessor directive.																							
																									
1	Structure Definition:																								
			struct Student {																						
			char rollNumber[20];																						
			char name[50];																						
			int age;																						
			float marks;																						
			};																						
	Defines a structure *Student* to represent each studentâ€™s information, including roll number, name, age, and marks																								
	 																								
2	Function Definition:																								
	a.	 'addStudent' Function																							
			void addStudent(struct Student *database, int *numStudents)																						
	Takes the input for a new student and adds them to the database																								
																									
	b.	 'displayStudents' Function:																							
			void displayStudents(const struct Student *database, int numStudents)																						
	Displays all the students in the database																								
																									
3	Main Function:																								
			int main()																						
	Defines the main function where the program execution starts																								
																									
4	Constants and Variables																								
			const int maxStudents = 100;																						
			struct Student studentDB[maxStudents];																						
			int numStudents = 0;																						
			int choice;																						
	Sets the maximum number of students in the database.																								
	 																								
	numStudents keeps track of the current number of students in the database.																								
	choice is used to store the user's menu choice.																								
																									
5	Main Menu Loop:																								
			do {																						
			// Display menu options																						
			// ...																						
			// Prompt user for choice																						
			scanf("%d", &choice);																						
																									
			switch (choice) {																						
			// ...																						
			}																						
			} while (choice != 3);																						
	This program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit (Option 3)																								
																									
6	Switch Statement for Menu Options:																								
			switch (choice) {																						
			case 1:																						
			addStudent(studentDB, &numStudents);																						
			break;																						
			case 2:																						
			displayStudents(studentDB, numStudents);																						
			break;																						
			case 3:																						
			printf("Exiting the program...\n");																						
			break;																						
			default:																						
			printf("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid option.\n");																						
			}																						
	Handles user's menu choice using a switch statement			 																					
	Calls corresponding funtions based on the user's input																								
																									
7	 'addStudents' Function Details:																								
																									
	Prompts the user to input students input (roll number, name, age, marks)																								
	Increments 'numStudents' after successfully adding a student																								
																									
8	 'displayStudents' Function Details:																								
																									
	Prints the header for student database table																								
	Iterates through the 'studentDB' array and prints each student's information
